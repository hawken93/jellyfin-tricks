# jellyfin-tricks

Just random scripts that can be useful with jellyfin development.

The script present in this folder is intended to help rebase your branch after jellyfin is minified. Make sure to edit the varibles
in the script before you run it, and that you also read and understand it. I can't make any guarantees, so take backups if you are
unsure. :)
